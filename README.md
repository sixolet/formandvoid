# Form and Void

Don't be without it.

Form and Void is a MPE synth script for Norns. It produces sound by
producing tiny grains of sine waves and FM'd sine waves at audio
rate. The frequency of the grains produces the "formants" of the sound
you hear; the frequency at which we produce them is the fundamental.

Form and Void includes four modulation sources (two ADSR envelopes,
one LFO, and the input pressure), eight internal modulation targets, a
mod matrix, and the ability to map *any* synthesis parameter as a
modulation target for any MIDI CC in a polyphonically-expressive
manner using the normal Norns parameter mapping system.
